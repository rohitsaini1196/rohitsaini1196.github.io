description: "About Rohit Saini — backend engineer, systems thinker, and builder."
---

I'm Rohit — a backend engineer focused on distributed systems, search infrastructure, and streaming pipelines. Most of my time goes into designing systems that handle data at scale and making sure they stay up when things go wrong.

Day to day, I work across:

- Distributed systems and service architecture
- Search and ranking infrastructure (OpenSearch / Elasticsearch)
- Stream processing and event-driven systems (Kafka)
- Applied AI — moving models from notebooks into production with proper guardrails
- Developer tooling and platform engineering

What I've learned to care about over the years:

- Clean boundaries between systems — get these wrong and everything downstream suffers
- Code that's readable six months later, not just when it's fresh
- Observability before optimization — you can't fix what you can't see
- Performance backed by data, not instinct
- Saying no to unnecessary complexity

I believe boring technology wins. The most reliable systems I've built used proven databases, simple queue-based architectures, and clear ownership boundaries. I'm skeptical of hype cycles — but genuinely curious about real breakthroughs, especially where AI meets backend systems in practical ways.

A few principles I operate by:

- Start with the data flow
- Design for failure, not just the happy path
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Make systems observable before making them fast
- Document _why_, not just _what_

Outside of work:

- I spend time in the mountains — altitude resets perspective
- I build small side projects to stress-test ideas
- I read about systems thinking and decision making
- I value slow thinking and long-term consistency over noise

This website is intentionally minimal.  
No trackers. No analytics dashboards. No unnecessary JavaScript.

Just writing, notes, and things I'm thinking about.
